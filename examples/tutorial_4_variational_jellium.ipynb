    "Variational quantum algorithms are a broad set of methods which involve optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit applied to some initial state (called the \"reference\") in order to minimize a cost function defined with respect to the output state (called the \"ansatz\"). In the context of quantum simulation, very often the goal is to prepare ground states and the cost function is the expectation value of a Hamiltonian. Thus, if we define the reference (initial state) as $\\lvert \\psi\\rangle$, the Hamiltonian as $H$ and the parameterized quantum circuit as $U(\\vec{\\theta})$ where $\\vec{\\theta}$ are the varaitional parameters, then the goal is to minimize the cost function\n",

    "E(\\vec \\theta) =  \\langle \\psi \\rvert\n",
    "U^\\dagger(\\vec{\\theta}) H U(\\vec{\\theta})\n",
    "\\lvert \\psi\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A classical optimization algorithm can be used to find the $\\vec{\\theta}$ that minimizes the value of the expression. The performance of a variational algorithm depends crucially on the choice of ansatz circuit $U(\\vec{\\theta})$, the choice of reference, and the strategy for choosing the initial parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ since typically global optimizing is challenging and one needs to begin reasonably close to the intended state. One possibility is to use an ansatz of the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(\\vec{\\theta}) = \\prod_j \\exp(-i \\theta_j H_j)\n",
    "$$\n",

OpenFermion-Cirq contains routines for constructing ansatzes of this form which use as templates the Trotter step algorithms implemented in the `trotter` module.\n",

For this example, we will prepare the initial state as an eigenstate of the one-body operator of the Hamiltonian. Since the one-body operator is a quadratic Hamiltonian, its eigenstates can be prepared using the `prepare_gaussian_state` method. We will use the HamiltonianVariationalStudy class, which stores a Hamiltonian and evaluates parameters by simulating the corresponding quantum circuit and computing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian on the final state. The SwapNetworkTrotterAnsatz class also includes a default setting of parameters which is inspired by the idea of state preparation by adiabatic evolution the mean-field state."
